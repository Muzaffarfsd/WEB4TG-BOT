## User Preferences
- **Язык общения**: Всегда писать на русском языке
- **Развёртывание**: Бот работает ТОЛЬКО на Railway, НЕ запускать на Replit

## System Architecture
The bot is developed in Python, leveraging Telegram Bot API 9.4. It features a modular handler architecture, a unified PostgreSQL database connection pool, and TTL caching. The system incorporates robust analytics for funnel tracking and A/B testing.
